# Two Concepts in Blockchain

### 1. Distributed Ledger

The core concept of blockchain is the Distributed Ledger Technology. A distributed ledger in blockchain is an immutable sequence of transaction records which is maintained in the peer-to-peer network. Each node in the network maintains a copy of the ledger of transactions that have been validated by a consensus protocol which ensures the order of executing transactions are consistent across the nodes.

### 2. Smart Contracts

A smart contract is an application which functions when a set of predefined conditions are met. It ensures trust, security and transparency of transactions in a blockchain with the help of the consensus protocol.
